                    What this work in progress project focuses on developing and recreating on my music apps I prefer to use 
                    for Personal use, Studying, or hitting the gym is developing a Spotify music player web app. The project focuses
                    on practicing my already known front-end skills and experimenting with playlist and audio playback features 
                    just like how would user's do it in the actual app. This project would also integrate the use of API which I've 
                    haven't learn but as we progress making this project it will come sense and using for the backend using Node.JS which
                    haven't learned.

                   This project is designed to manage a list of vehicles when to the user wants to add a vehicle to the system whether it be a car, or jetski in this case.
                     The user can add, update, delete, and view all the vehicles in the system and this project is created using C# and .NET framework for the backend and frontend
                   my ability to implement functional, real-time features in a clean, visual way. Along with that it stores the user's data in a JSON file for persistence and retrieval of data along with that
                   we added a menu bar which allows the user to create a new JSON file and open existing JSON file to allows the user to add more vehicles or remove when needed.
