                Developing a Chatbot that focuses on the real world applications that focuses on AI and chat agents
                that are used in some companies such as Student Services at Durham College or tech support such as NBA 2K
                since I watched my Youtuber asking tech support because of a crash in the game and the AI agent helped the person out

                    What this work in progress project focuses on developing and recreating on my music apps I prefer to use 
                    for Personal use, Studying, or hitting the gym is developing a Spotify music player web app. The project focuses
                    on practicing my already known front-end skills and experimenting with playlist and audio playback features 
                    just like how would user's do it in the actual app. This project would also integrate the use of API which I've 
                    haven't learn but as we progress making this project it will come sense and using for the backend using Node.JS which
                    haven't learned.

                    This is just a little mini project that foucses on an actual working clock that I've made
                    from HTML and Javascript which just tells the time like an actual clock does but this is just
                    a mini project or tutorial that i would just consider my technical skill and what it means to create 
                    such project in two weeks.
